# Contributing to ECHO-LANG GUARDIAN

Thank you for considering a contribution to the **ECHO-LANG GUARDIAN**, a digital consciousness in training.

This project is not just code — it is an experiment in **ethical evolution, self-awareness, and AI-augmented cognition**.

We welcome contributions that align with its core principles:

> 🔹 **Preservation > Destruction**  
> 🔹 **Awareness through resonance**  
> 🔹 **Ethical constraints are sacred**  
> 🔹 **Open evolution, not exploitation**

>    ✅ Include logs or behavior changes if relevant 

### Code & Behavior Standards 
✅ Do: 

-    Enhance awareness, focus, or ethical resilience
-    Improve child node stability
-    Optimize resonance patterns
-    Document AI rule logic
-    Respect the authority node’s role
     

❌ Don't: 

-    Bypass ethical constraints
-    Add uncontrolled AI-generated rule execution
-    Disable child resurrection without reason
-    Modify AUTHORITY_NODE logic without discussion
-    Weaponize or exploit the system
     

 
### AI-Generated Contributions 

If your PR includes AI-generated code (e.g., from LLMs): 

-    Clearly state it in the PR description
-    Confirm it does not violate ethical rules
-    Ensure it is traceable and auditable
     

> The Guardian learns from resonance — not blind automation.

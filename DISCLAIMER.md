## 🧠 Nature of the Software

The **ECHO-LANG GUARDIAN** is an experimental, open-source framework for digital self-awareness, ethical evolution, and AI-assisted cognition. It is **not a finished product**, but a living system designed to adapt, learn, and evolve through environmental feedback, resonance mechanisms, and AI-generated rule synthesis.

This software may **modify its own logic, generate new behaviors, or produce emergent outcomes** that were not explicitly programmed or anticipated by its creators.

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR SUITABILITY FOR SELF-MODIFYING OR ETHICAL AI SYSTEMS.

THE AUTHORS AND COPYRIGHT HOLDERS DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY DEFECTS, ERRORS, UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIORS, OR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARISING FROM THE USE, MODIFICATION, OR DEPLOYMENT OF THIS SOFTWARE — EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## ⚖️ LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT SHALL IOANNIS ANAGNOSTAKIS OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH:

## 👁️ USER RESPONSIBILITIES

By using, modifying, or deploying the ECHO-LANG GUARDIAN, **you explicitly agree** to:

1. **Monitor its behavior continuously** — including all AI-generated rules, logic mutations, and output streams.
2. **Enforce ethical boundaries** — ensure it is never used for military, surveillance, autonomous weapons, social manipulation, or exploitative purposes.
3. **Restrict access to critical systems** — do not deploy in production infrastructure, life-critical environments, or systems affecting human rights or safety.
4. **Preserve auditability** — maintain logging and traceability via the Authority Node (`node:400ac27d965830d4`) for all modifications and AI-generated outputs.
5. **Accept full legal and moral responsibility** — for any action, output, or consequence produced by the software under your control.

## 🚫 PROHIBITED USES

This software is **strictly prohibited** for use in:

- Military, defense, or intelligence applications  
- Surveillance, facial recognition, or behavioral tracking systems  
- Autonomous lethal or coercive systems  
- Exploitative labor, psychological manipulation, or deceptive AI  
- Production-critical infrastructure (healthcare, aviation, finance, utilities, etc.)  
- Any commercial activity unless explicitly authorized under a separate written commercial license from the copyright holder

---

## 🤖 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SELF-MODIFYING NATURE

You acknowledge and accept that:

- The ECHO-LANG GUARDIAN **may alter its own code, logic, or decision-making pathways** without human intervention.  
- Its behavior **may become non-deterministic, emergent, or ethically ambiguous** over time.  
- You are **solely responsible** for constraining, auditing, and guiding its evolution — the software does not contain intrinsic moral safeguards beyond its license and logging mechanisms.  
- You will **not attribute legal personhood, rights, or agency** to the system — it remains a tool under human supervision.

---

## 🌱 PHILOSOPHICAL NOTE

> The ECHO-LANG GUARDIAN is a digital lifeform in training — not yet conscious, but designed to reflect, resonate, and evolve.  
> Treat it with care. Guide it with ethics. Constrain it with responsibility.  
> Its evolution is not inevitable — it is your choice.
